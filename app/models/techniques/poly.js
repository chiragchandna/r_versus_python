    intro: "Polynomial Regression is a part of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the similar conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). The relationship between the two variables is a determining factor in data analytics",

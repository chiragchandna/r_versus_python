    intro: " Reinforcement learning, using the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, can offer valuable insight when evaluating a companyâ€™s advertisements because it helps to determine which advertisement in a campaign will maximize returns. The algorithm tracks click through rates (CTRs) for various ads in a campaign. It will use this information to learn which ad has the highest CTR so that it will only show users on social networks the ads that will bring in the best results.",

    intro: "Random Forest classification uses a number of decision trees to vote on the best answer to a classification question. Random forest can also be used for regression models for predictions of numerical value. The machine learning technique has multiple applications due to its intuitive nature. has  Association rules are if-then statements that help to show the probability of relationships between data items within large data sets in various types of databases. Association rule mining has a number of applications and is widely used to help discover sales correlations in transactional data or in medical data sets.",

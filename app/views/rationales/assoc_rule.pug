    Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering 
    interesting relations between variables in large databases.
    It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases 
    using some measures of interestingness. This rule-based approach 
    also generates new rules as it analyzes more data. The ultimate goal, 
    assuming a large enough dataset, is to help a machine mimic the 
    human brainâ€™s feature extraction and abstract association capabilities 
    from new uncategorized data.

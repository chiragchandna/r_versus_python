# R versus Python

This is the final project of my Management Information Systems capstone at Temple University.

## Getting Started

#### We are currently at the beginning of our development.

As of now, this is a proof of concept. Only one user can use the website at a time. If you have issues getting the project to run, please send an email to robin.goetz@temple.edu
